A small tool help me play SanguoKill (a card game in ios and android) well. It can tell me which charater should be selected first. 

Please install pygraphviz and graphviz first.

Or you cannot use the AchievementsPlot class.

Just try:

	python Characters.py
	python Achievements.py
Only you can import pygraphviz:

	python AchievementsPlot.py
